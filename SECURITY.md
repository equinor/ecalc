# Security Policy

Security is very important for eCalcâ„¢ and [Equinor](https://www.equinor.com/) ðŸ”’

Learn more about it below. ðŸ‘‡

## Vulnerability scanning

We scan our code in GitHub Actions using inbuilt GHAS (GitHub Advanced Security)
and [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
to ensure code quality and identify third party vulnerabilities. The pipelines are continuously monitored by our
developers
to ensure that eCalcâ„¢ meets the strict security requirements of [Equinor](https://www.equinor.com/).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you have found a security vulnerability in our open source project, we encourage you to report it to us as soon as
possible. We take all security vulnerabilities seriously and will investigate all reports promptly.

Report discretely to the maintainers of this repo by visiting the [Security tab](https://github.com/equinor/ecalc/security) on the project page, and report from there.

For less critical and potential security vulnerabilities, please open an GitHub Issue with the label security with relevant information.
