# Get started
This site was generated from the contents of your `documentation` folder using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

You will find the full documentation of Docusaurus here: [Docusaurus Docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next).

## Prerequisites
You can contribute as long as you have access to the [ecalc - GitHub Repository](https://github.com/equinor/ecalc).
It is entirely possible to make changes by using your web browser alone. However, if you want to get live feedback on your
changes, we recommend that you run the documentation locally with the following prerequisites:

* *Linux or macOS*: For [Windows you can run Ubuntu or similar in WSL 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).
* *Git*: [Set up Git](../guides/git.md#setting-up-git)
* *Node*: Download from nodejs.org or use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

:::info
Since not all managed computers have the ability to install Node, you can use an IDE such as PyCharm, IntelliJ, VSCode, or similar, to preview Markdown code.
This has some limitations such as missing navigation bar, and it does not preview Docusaurus specific syntax such as the Admonitions used here.

## Contributing

As a contributor you will have to use Git. Please find the [Git Documentation](../guides/git.md) for more details about git.


## How it works

From Docusaurus own documentation:
> Docusaurus is a static-site generator. It builds a single-page application with fast client-side navigation, leveraging the full power of React to make your site interactive. It provides out-of-the-box documentation features but can be used to create any kind of site (personal website, product, blog, marketing landing pages, etc).

While Docusaurus is rich on features, we use it mostly to host markdown pages. The main bulk of the documentation is located in `documentation/docs`. This is where you as a collaborator are encouraged to make changes.

For a quick intro to Markdown, see our [Markdown section](markdown.md).

## Special features

Docusuaurs has some special features that we are using actively. Please find the links listed here:

* [Math Equations using LaTeX](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/markdown-features/math-equations)
* [Code blocks](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/markdown-features/code-blocks)
* [Admonitions](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/markdown-features/admonitions)
* [Diagrams using Mermaid](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/markdown-features/diagrams)
* [Head metadata](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/markdown-features/head-metadata) to set titles, menu order, etc.
