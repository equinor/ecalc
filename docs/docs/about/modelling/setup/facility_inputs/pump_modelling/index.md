# Pump modelling
# Attention
Pumps can both be single speed and variable speed. Often, the pumping capacity on an installation is filled with a system of several pumps in parallel.

:::warning Attention
The pump models in eCalc™ are intended for water, i.e., there is no friction dependency.
Thus, for usage in other types of pumps (e.g.,  where the
fluid viscosity changes with the fluid mixture), the results might not be as intended.
:::

Core theory behind the modelling of pumps in eCalc™ can be found [here](../../../../modelling/theory/pump_modelling).
