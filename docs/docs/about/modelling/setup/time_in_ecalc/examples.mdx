# Examples

The following is an example which has two time series as input, in two different csv files. with different dates. One
time series has quarterly input, the other has monthly input over a slightly longer period of time. The csv files and a
figure showing the data is shown below:

<CodeBlock title="time_series_A.csv">{timeSeriesA}</CodeBlock>
<CodeBlock title="time_series_B.csv">{timeSeriesB}</CodeBlock>

In this case there is no information about the global start and end dates in the YAML model file. Then eCalc™ needs to
extract this information from the time series csv files. In this case the start will be 01/09/2019 and the end will be
01/04/2021. Time series B also needs values for all the dates where time series A has values. Between dates where time
series B already has values, this will be done through interpolation. The type of interpolation used is determined by
the [INTERPOLATION_TYPE](/about/references/INTERPOLATION_TYPE.md).

Dates that are prior to or after the existing dates, will be filled using extrapolation.

:::note
Notice that the last value given in time series B will be used for the period starting at the last date in the original
time series B, even when extrapolation is set to false
:::

Calculations within eCalc™ will only happen at the dates in the input time series. Within a period between two input
dates, the values are assumed to be constant, as shown in this plot.
