title: Single speed compressor train
sidebar_position: 1
---

The single speed compressor train model is modelling one or more single speed compressors mounted on a common shaft.
Being single speed compressors on a common shaft means that all compressors will run at the exact same fixed speed, and
this shaft speed can not be varied. Since the shaft speed can not vary, the problem is overdefined given the rate,
suction pressure and discharge pressure. A method for controlling the pressure also needs to be defined, to be able
to calculate the energy usage for given rates, suction pressures and discharge pressures.

This means that a single speed compressor model needs the following to be defined:

- A polytropic compressor chart for every compressor stage in the compressor train. For single speed trains, eCalc
  only supports user defined single speed compressor charts.
- [CONTROL_MARGIN](/about/references/CONTROL_MARGIN.md) and [CONTROL_MARGIN_UNIT](/about/references/CONTROL_MARGIN_UNIT.md) for each compressor stage in the train
- [FLUID_MODEL](/about/references/FLUID_MODEL.md)
- [PRESSURE_CONTROL](/about/references/PRESSURE_CONTROL.md)

<span className="changed-from-version">
**Changed in version 9.0:** CONTROL_MARGIN and CONTROL_MARGIN_UNIT are required

The following keywords are optional for a single speed compressor model:

- [MAXIMUM_DISCHARGE_PRESSURE](/about/references/MAXIMUM_DISCHARGE_PRESSURE.md)
- [POWER_ADJUSTMENT_CONSTANT](/about/references/POWER_ADJUSTMENT_CONSTANT.md)
- [MAXIMUM_POWER](/about/references/MAXIMUM_POWER.md)
- [CALCULATE_MAX_RATE](/about/references/CALCULATE_MAX_RATE.md)

The model is defined under the main keyword [MODELS](/about/references/MODELS.md) in the format
