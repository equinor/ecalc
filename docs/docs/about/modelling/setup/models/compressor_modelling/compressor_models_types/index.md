This section outlines the various compressor train types that are available in eCalcâ„¢. 
These are as follows:

- [`Single speed compressor train model`](/about/modelling/setup/models/compressor_modelling/compressor_models_types/single_speed_compressor_train_model.md)
- [`Variable speed compressor train model`](/about/modelling/setup/models/compressor_modelling/compressor_models_types/variable_speed_compressor_train_model.md)
- [`Simplified variable speed compressor train model`](/about/modelling/setup/models/compressor_modelling/compressor_models_types/simplified_variable_speed_compressor_train_model.md)
- [`Variable speed compressor train model with multiple streams and pressures`](/about/modelling/setup/models/compressor_modelling/compressor_models_types/variable_speed_compressor_train_model_with_multiple_streams_and_pressures.md)
