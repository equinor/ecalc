[FACTOR](FACTOR)

## Description
The keyword [FACTOR](FACTOR) can be used to add a multiplier. The
[FACTOR](FACTOR) keyword can be used in various places in the eCalc configuration file.
A factor can either be a number, or an `expression <Expressions>`.

:::warning Warning
The [FACTOR](FACTOR) keyword will have slightly different behavior depending on in which keyword
it is used. Carefully read the documentation below!

### Use in [ADJUSTMENT](ADJUSTMENT)

Adjustment of input data with a factor.

### Use in [EMISSIONS](EMISSIONS.md)
A single value with unit kg/Sm<sup>3</sup> defines the CO<sub>2</sub> factor for the fuel gas used on the
installation. That is, how many kilograms of CO<sub>2</sub> are emitted

## Format
~~~~~~~~yaml
FACTOR: <VALUE>
~~~~~~~~

## Example
### Use in [ADJUSTMENT](ADJUSTMENT)

Say you have input that that is of by 3% percentage.
You could fix this like:

~~~~~~~~yaml
NAME: some_facility_input
FILE: filename.csv
TYPE: FACILITY_INPUT_TYPE
ADJUSTMENT:
  FACTOR: 1.03
~~~~~~~~

The resulting energy consumption $E_\mathrm{adjusted}$, i.e. fuel or power, will then be

$$
E_\mathrm{adjusted} = 1.03 \times E_\mathrm{original}
$$

where $E_\mathrm{original}$ is the energy consumption before the adjustment.

### Use in [EMISSIONS](EMISSIONS.md)

Say your fuel emits 2.5 kg CO<sub>2</sub> per Sm<sup>3</sup> of burned fuel, you can model this like:

~~~~~~~~yaml
FUEL_TYPES:
  - NAME: my_fuel
    EMISSIONS:
      - NAME: CO2
        FACTOR: 2.5  # [kg/Sm3]
