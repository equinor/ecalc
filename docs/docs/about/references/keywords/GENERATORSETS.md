# GENERATORSETS

[INSTALLATIONS](INSTALLATIONS) / 
[GENERATORSETS](GENERATORSETS.md)

## Description
Under [GENERATORSETS](GENERATORSETS.md) one or
several `generator sets` (a 'set' of an engine of some sort and a generator) are specified in a list.
Each generator set requires three sub-keywords, [ELECTRICITY2FUEL](ELECTRICITY2FUEL) and 
[CONSUMERS](CONSUMERS) and [CATEGORY](CATEGORY).

This keyword is optional. However, the only requirement is that each
installation must have at least one of [GENERATORSETS](GENERATORSETS.md)
and [FUELCONSUMERS](FUELCONSUMERS.md).

See [GENERATOR SETS](docs/about/modelling/setup/installations/generator_sets_in_calculations) for more details about usage.
