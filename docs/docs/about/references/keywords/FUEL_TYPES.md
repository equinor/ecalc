## Description
`FUEL_TYPES` is one of six top level section keywords in eCalc™.

This part of the setup specifies the various fuel types and associated emissions
used in the model. Each fuel type is specified in a list and the defined fuels can later be referred to the 
[INSTALLATIONS](/about/references/keywords/INSTALLATIONS.md) part of the setup by its name.

The use of fuel can lead to one or more emission types, specified in [EMISSIONS](/about/references/keywords/EMISSIONS.md).
You can optionally specify a [CATEGORY](/about/references/keywords/CATEGORY.md).

See [FUEL TYPES](/about/modelling/setup/fuel_types.md) for more details about usage.
