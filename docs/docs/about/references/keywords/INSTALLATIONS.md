[INSTALLATIONS](INSTALLATIONS)

## Description

In [INSTALLATIONS](INSTALLATIONS) the system of energy consumers is described. Installations, in this setting, are typically the different platforms and production units for a field, group of fields, or area. Mobile units (such as drilling rigs) are also modelled as an installation.

The structure of the keywords under installations
is linked to the structure in the general consumer overview for an installation.
