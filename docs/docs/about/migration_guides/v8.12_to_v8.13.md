# v8.12 to v8.13

In this migration guide you will find:

1. [YAML changes](#yaml-migration)

## Yaml migration

### 1. Changes to VENTING_EMITTERS
- Introducing `VENTING_EMITTERS` `TYPE`
- Two types can be defined in `TYPE`: `DIRECT_EMISSION` and `OIL_VOLUME`
- For the `DIRECT_EMISSION` type the following should be specified:
  - `EMISSIONS` (`EMISSION` is deprecated): Multiple emissions can be specified, each defined by `NAME` and `RATE`
- For the `OIL_VOLUME` type the following should be specified:
  - `VOLUME`: The oil volume/rate associated with loading/storage are defined using `RATE`. Multiple emissions are specified using the `EMISSIONS` keyword. Each emission is defined by `NAME` and `EMISSION_FACTOR`. The emission factor is used to calculate emissions as a fraction of oil loading/storage volumes.
  

Previously, the format looked like this:

```yaml
VENTING_EMITTERS:
  - NAME: <emitter name>
    CATEGORY: <category>
    # This is old
    EMISSION:
      # This is old
      NAME: <emission name>
      # This is old
      RATE:
        # This is old
        VALUE: <emission rate>
        # This is old
        UNIT: <emission rate unit, default kg/d>
        # This is old
        TYPE: <emission rate type, default STREAM_DAY>
```

The new valid definition of `VENTING_EMITTERS` in the yaml is now, for type `DIRECT_EMISSION`:

```yaml
VENTING_EMITTERS:
  - NAME: <emitter name>
    CATEGORY: <category>
    # This is new
    TYPE: DIRECT_EMISSION
    # This is new
    EMISSIONS:
      # This is new
      - NAME: <emission name 1>
      # This is new
        RATE:
        # This is new
          VALUE: <emission rate 1>
        # This is new
          UNIT: <emission rate unit, default kg/d>
        # This is new
          TYPE: <emission rate type, default STREAM_DAY>
      # This is new
      - NAME: <emission name 2>
      # This is new
        RATE:
        # This is new
          VALUE: <emission rate 2>
        # This is new
          UNIT: <emission rate unit, default kg/d>
        # This is new
          TYPE: <emission rate type, default STREAM_DAY>
```

The new valid definition of `VENTING_EMITTERS` in the yaml is now, for type `OIL_VOLUME`:

```yaml
VENTING_EMITTERS:
  - NAME: <emitter name>
    CATEGORY: <category>
    # This is new
    TYPE: OIL_VOLUME
    # This is new
    VOLUME:
      # This is new
      RATE:
        # This is new
        VALUE: <oil loading/storage volume rate>
        # This is new
        UNIT: <volume rate unit, default kg/d>
        # This is new
        TYPE: <rate type, default STREAM_DAY>
      # This is new
      EMISSIONS:
        # This is new
        - NAME: <emission name 1>
          # This is new
          EMISSION_FACTOR: <volume to emission factor 1>
        # This is new
        - NAME: <emission name 2>
          # This is new
          EMISSION_FACTOR: <volume to emission factor 2>
```

Example with the new yaml-definition of `VENTING_EMITTERS`, for `DIRECT_EMISSION` type:

```yaml
VENTING_EMITTERS:
  - NAME: SomeVentingEmitter
    CATEGORY: COLD-VENTING-FUGITIVE
    # This is new
    TYPE: DIRECT_EMISSION
    # This is new
    EMISSIONS:
      # This is new
      - NAME: CO2
      # This is new
        RATE:
        # This is new
          VALUE: 2
        # This is new
          UNIT: kg/d
        # This is new
          TYPE: STREAM_DAY
      # This is new
      - NAME: CH4
      # This is new
        RATE:
        # This is new
          VALUE: 4
        # This is new
          UNIT: kg/d
        # This is new
          TYPE: STREAM_DAY

```
