# v8.7 to v8.8

In this migration guide you will find:

1. [YAML changes](#yaml-migration)

## Yaml migration

### 1. Changes to VENTING_EMITTERS
- Update `VENTING_EMITTERS` to support rate `TYPE` and `UNIT`
- `EMITTER_MODEL` is deprecated and replaced by a new keyword `EMISSION`
- In the new keyword `EMISSION` the following should be specified: 
  - `NAME` of the emission
  - `RATE`, including `VALUE` and optionally `UNIT` and `TYPE`

Previously, the format looked like this:

```yaml
VENTING_EMITTERS:
  - NAME: <emitter name>
    CATEGORY: <category>
    # This is old
    EMISSION_NAME: <emission name>
    # This is old
    EMITTER_MODEL:
      # This is old
      - EMISSION_RATE: <emission rate [kg/day]>
```

But the new valid definition of `VENTING_EMITTERS` in the yaml is now:

```yaml
VENTING_EMITTERS:
  - NAME: <emitter name>
    CATEGORY: <category>
    # This is new
    EMISSION:
      # This is new
      NAME: <emission name>
      # This is new
      RATE:
        # This is new
        VALUE: <emission rate>
        # This is new
        UNIT: <emission rate unit, default kg/d>
        # This is new
        TYPE: <emission rate type, default STREAM_DAY>
```
Example with the new yaml-definition of `VENTING_EMITTERS`:

```yaml
VENTING_EMITTERS:
  - NAME: SomeVentingEmitter
    CATEGORY: COLD-VENTING-FUGITIVE
    # This is new
    EMISSION:
      # This is new
      NAME: CH4
      # This is new
      RATE:
        # This is new
        VALUE: 4
        # This is new
        UNIT: kg/d
        # This is new
        TYPE: STREAM_DAY
```
