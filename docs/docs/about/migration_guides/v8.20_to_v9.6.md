# Migration guide v8.20 to v9.6

This migration guide is intended to help you migrate your existing eCalcâ„¢ model from version v8.20 to v9.6. The guide
is divided into 3 sections; **v8.22 to v8.23**, **v8.26 to v9.0** and **v9.0 to v9.6**. Make sure to go through the
whole guide to make sure you have updated your model(s) correctly.

## v8.22 to v8.23

### 1. Changes to COMPOSITION
- `H2O` is no longer allowed in a fluid composition, `water` should be used instead 

```yaml 
MODELS:
- NAME: <name of fluid model, for reference>
  TYPE: FLUID
  FLUID_MODEL_TYPE: COMPOSITION
  EOS_MODEL: <eos model>
  COMPOSITION:
    # This is old
    H2O: <mole fraction>
    # This is new
    water: <mole fraction>
    nitrogen: <mole fraction>
    CO2: <mole fraction>
    methane: <mole fraction, required>
    ethane: <mole fraction>
    propane: <mole fraction>
    i_butane: <mole fraction>
    n_butane: <mole fraction>
    i_pentane: <mole fraction>
    n_pentane: <mole fraction>
    n_hexane: <mole fraction>
```


## v8.26 to v9.0

### Changes to compressor trains in MODELS

- `CONTROL_MARGIN` and `CONTROL_MARGIN_UNIT` are now required for `SINGLE_SPEED_COMPRESSOR_TRAIN`, `VARIABLE_SPEED_COMPRESSOR_TRAIN` and `VARIABLE_SPEED_COMPRESSOR_TRAIN_MULTIPLE_STREAMS_AND_PRESSURES`.

An example with new yaml implementation is shown below:

```yaml 
MODELS:
  - NAME: <model name>
    TYPE: SINGLE_SPEED_COMPRESSOR_TRAIN
    FLUID_MODEL: <reference to fluid model>
    PRESSURE_CONTROL: <method for pressure control, DOWNSTREAM_CHOKE (default), UPSTREAM_CHOKE, , INDIVIDUAL_ASV_PRESSURE, INDIVIDUAL_ASV_RATE or COMMON_ASV>
    MAXIMUM_DISCHARGE_PRESSURE: <Maximum discharge pressure in bar (can only use if pressure control is DOWNSTREAM_CHOKE)>
    COMPRESSOR_TRAIN:
      STAGES:
        - INLET_TEMPERATURE: <inlet temperature in Celsius for stage>
          COMPRESSOR_CHART: <reference to compressor chart model for first stage, must be defined in MODELS or FACILITY_INPUTS>
          PRESSURE_DROP_AHEAD_OF_STAGE: <Pressure drop before compression stage [in bar]>
          # This is new
          CONTROL_MARGIN: <Default value is zero>
          # This is new
          CONTROL_MARGIN_UNIT: <FRACTION or PERCENTAGE, default is PERCENTAGE>
        - INLET_TEMPERATURE: <inlet temperature in Celsius for stage>
          COMPRESSOR_CHART: <reference to compressor chart model for second stage, must be defined in MODELS or FACILITY_INPUTS>
          PRESSURE_DROP_AHEAD_OF_STAGE: <Pressure drop before compression stage [in bar]>
          # This is new
          CONTROL_MARGIN: <Default value is zero>
          # This is new
          CONTROL_MARGIN_UNIT: <FRACTION or PERCENTAGE, default is PERCENTAGE>
        - ... and so forth for each stage in the train
    POWER_ADJUSTMENT_CONSTANT: <Optional constant MW adjustment added to the model>
    MAXIMUM_POWER: <Optional constant MW maximum power the compressor train can require>
    CALCULATE_MAX_RATE: <Optional compressor train max standard rate [Sm3/day] in result if set to true. Default false. Use with caution. This will increase runtime significantly. >
```

### Changes to simplified compressor trains in MODELS

- `CONTROL_MARGIN` and `CONTROL_MARGIN_UNIT` are not allowed for `SIMPLIFIED_VARIABLE_SPEED_COMPRESSOR_TRAIN`.

The new yaml implementation is described below, for simplified compressor train model with known compressor stages:

```yaml 
MODELS:
  - NAME: <model name>
    TYPE: SIMPLIFIED_VARIABLE_SPEED_COMPRESSOR_TRAIN
    FLUID_MODEL: <reference to fluid model>
    COMPRESSOR_TRAIN:
      STAGES:
        - INLET_TEMPERATURE: <inlet temperature in Celsius for stage>
          COMPRESSOR_CHART: <reference to compressor chart model for first stage, must be defined in MODELS or FACILITY_INPUTS>
          # This is old
          CONTROL_MARGIN: <Default value is zero>
          # This is old
          CONTROL_MARGIN_UNIT: <FRACTION or PERCENTAGE, default is PERCENTAGE>
        - INLET_TEMPERATURE: <inlet temperature in Celsius for stage>
          COMPRESSOR_CHART: <reference to compressor chart model for second stage, must be defined in MODELS or FACILITY_INPUTS>
          # This is old
          CONTROL_MARGIN: <Default value is zero>
          # This is old
          CONTROL_MARGIN_UNIT: <FRACTION or PERCENTAGE, default is PERCENTAGE>
        - ... and so forth for each stage in the train
    POWER_ADJUSTMENT_CONSTANT: <Optional constant MW adjustment added to the model>
    MAXIMUM_POWER: <Optional constant MW maximum power the compressor train can require>
```
- Simplified compressor trains have to use generic compressor charts
  - `SIMPLIFIED_VARIABLE_SPEED_COMPRESSOR_TRAIN` is restricted to generic compressor charts, i.e. the `COMPRESSOR_CHART` must be of type `GENERIC_FROM_INPUT` or `GENERIC_FROM_DESIGN_POINT`. The chart types `SINGLE_SPEED` and `VARIABLE_SPEED` are not allowed anymore.

## v9.0 to v9.6

### Important Control Margin changes for compressors

* `CONTROL_MARGIN` and `CONTROL_MARGIN_UNIT` are **REQUIRED** for compressors for single compressors and compressor systems.
* `CONTROL_MARGIN` and `CONTROL_MARGIN_UNIT` are **NO LONGER ALLOWED** for simplified compressor trains.
* Simplified trains **HAVE TO USE** generic charts - single speed- and variable speed charts are not allowed.

### Enforcing more unique names

* Fixed a bug where electrical consumers are required to have **UNIQUE** names.
* The following elements **MUST** also have **UNIQUE** names: `MODELS`, `FACILITY_INPUT`, `TIME_SERIES`, `FUEL_TYPES` and `EMISSIONS` names.
