# v8.1 to v8.2

1. [YAML changes](#yaml-migration)
2. [Result changes](#result-changes)


## Yaml migration
### LTP
1. Two new consumer categories are added: [`HEATER`](../references/keywords/CATEGORY) and [`BOILER`](../references/keywords/CATEGORY)

## Result changes

### operational settings used is now 1-based

Consumer systems will now refer to the first operational setting as 1 instead of 0. Zero means "No setting used".

### Output LTP
1. Column Total CO2 is removed from LTP output (both for fixed & mobile installations)
2. Add relevant columns in ltp-file for the two new consumer categories [`HEATER`](../references/keywords/CATEGORY) and [`BOILER`](../references/keywords/CATEGORY)
3. Re-order some of the columns in the ltp-file, for more logical order
4. Move column for CO2 fugitives for more logical structure: CO2-column "co2VentingMass" moved after other CO2-columns
5. Turbine-columns are now filtered on the two consumer categories [`TURBINE-GENERATOR`](../references/keywords/CATEGORY) and [`GAS-DRIVEN-COMPRESSOR`](../references/keywords/CATEGORY), as it is no longer only turbines that are consumers of FUEL-GAS

### Output STP
1. Remove CH4 column for mobile installations in stp-file
2. Change names of stp output columns to align headings with Centuries, for proper import of data
3. Report CO2 emissions for both fixed- and mobile installations
