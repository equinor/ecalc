# v8.1 to v8.2

1. [YAML changes](#yaml-migration)
2. [Result changes](#result-changes)


## Yaml migration
### LTP
1. Two new consumer categories are added: [`HEATER`](../references/keywords/CATEGORY) and [`BOILER`](../references/keywords/CATEGORY)

## Result changes

### operational settings used is now 1-based

Consumer systems will now refer to the first operational setting as 1 instead of 0. Zero means "No setting used".

### Resampling of rates changed from forward filling to average rates

All calculations are performed on a global time vector, which is the union of all dates found in the 
input resource files (csv files) where [INFLUENCE_TIME_VECTOR](../references/keywords/INFLUENCE_TIME_VECTOR) is set to 
True, dates found in the eCalc model yaml-file (temporal models), and dates in the requested output frequency.

If the global time vector and the dates in the requested output frequency does not coincide fully, a resampling of the 
results needs to be performed. Previously this was done by simply picking the first 
available rate in the time interval (forward filling). The rates are thought to be constant in a period between two 
dates, hence the forward filling will disconnect the rates and the cumulative volumes. This has now been changed to 
calculating the average rate from all dates in the global time vector within a date range in the requested output 
frequency, to keep the rate and cumulative consistent with each other. This average will take into 
account the lengths of the periods and the regularity within each period. The figure below shows a comparison of how the
resampling would previously have been done compared to how it is done now when making quarterly output from monthly results.

### Output LTP
1. Column Total CO2 is removed from LTP output (both for fixed & mobile installations)
2. Add relevant columns in ltp-file for the two new consumer categories [`HEATER`](../references/keywords/CATEGORY) and [`BOILER`](../references/keywords/CATEGORY)
3. Re-order some of the columns in the ltp-file, for more logical order
4. Move column for CO2 fugitives for more logical structure: CO2-column "co2VentingMass" moved after other CO2-columns
5. Turbine-columns are now filtered on the two consumer categories [`TURBINE-GENERATOR`](../references/keywords/CATEGORY) and [`GAS-DRIVEN-COMPRESSOR`](../references/keywords/CATEGORY), as it is no longer only turbines that are consumers of FUEL-GAS

### Output STP
1. Remove CH4 column for mobile installations in stp-file
2. Change names of stp output columns to align headings with Centuries, for proper import of data
3. Report CO2 emissions for both fixed- and mobile installations
