# v9.12 to v9.13

In this migration guide you will find:

1. Information on date-input changes and constraints.

### Migration overview

This doc guides you through migrating an existing eCalc™ model from the minor version v9.12 to v9.13.

We try to make this as easy as possible, and provide a step-by-step migration guide.

### Main differences

1. Enforce stricter rules for dates enforced

#### 1. Enforce stricter rules for dates

The input dates within one file/resource must follow a common and accepted format.
This ensures a mix of month-first and day-first cannot exist and cause misinterpretation.
If time is present for one datapoint in file/resource, it must be included in all datapoints.

Accepted formats:

- *ISO8601* — YYYY.MM.DD
- *ISO8601* (with time) — YYYY.MM.DD HH:MM:SS
- *Day-first* — DD.MM.YYYY
- *Day-first* (with time) — DD.MM.YYYY HH:MM:SS
- *Year only* — YYYY

The change should not affect the getting of a model, but running updating and creating models/files should fail with a
reasonable error message.
