# v9.0 to v9.6 migration

This doc guides you through migrating an existing eCalcâ„¢ model from version v9.0 to v9.6.

## Important Control Margin changes for compressors

* `CONTROL_MARGIN` and `CONTROL_MARGIN_UNIT` are **REQUIRED** for compressors for single compressors and compressor systems.
* `CONTROL_MARGIN` and `CONTROL_MARGIN_UNIT` are **NO LONGER ALLOWED** for simplified compressor trains.
* Simplified trains **HAVE TO USE** generic charts - single speed- and variable speed charts are not allowed.

## Enforcing more unique names

* Fixed a bug where electrical consumers were allowed to have duplicate names. Also the following elements must also
have duplicate names: `MODELS`, `FACILITY_INPUT`, `TIME_SERIES`, `FUEL_TYPES` and `EMISSIONS` names.
