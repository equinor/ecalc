# v9.13 to v10

In this migration guide you will find:

1. How to apply the new `END` keyword in YAML files.

### Migration overview

- The `END` keyword is now required in the YAML file. This has to be added at the top level. The dates in each row in the different time series resource input
  files corresponds to the start date of a period in the eCalc simulation. To avoid having to guess when the last period
  in the eCalc model should end it is now required to explicitly specify the end date using the [END](../references/END) keyword.
- If the last value in your time series is e.g. `2032-01-01`, the values given there should probably be valid for one year, i.e. until `2033-01-01`. This is the date that should be specified in the `END` keyword.
- The [START](../references/START) keyword is however NOT required, it is optional, but encouraged to use it for clarity. If `START` is omitted, we simply use the
first date among all the time series as the start date. However, note that there is an `INFLUENCE_TIME_VECTOR` attribute for [TIME_SERIES](../references/TIME_SERIES#attributes-dependent-on-time-series-type), whether the time series should affect the global
timeseries that is used for the simulation. (It is default set to `True`.)
- Please verify when you run, that the last time step is as expected wrt. extrapolation that is done for the last time step.

```yaml
# This is new
END: 2033-01-01

TIME_SERIES:   
    ...
```
