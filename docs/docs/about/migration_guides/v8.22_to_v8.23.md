# v8.22 to v8.23

In this migration guide you will find:

1. [YAML changes](#yaml-migration)

## Yaml migration

### Migration overview

This doc guides you through migrating an existing eCalcâ„¢ model from version v8.22 to v8.23.

We try to make this as easy as possible, and provide a step-by-step migration guide.

### 1. Changes to COMPOSITION
- `H2O` is no longer allowed in a fluid composition, `water` should be used instead 

```yaml 
MODELS:
- NAME: <name of fluid model, for reference>
  TYPE: FLUID
  FLUID_MODEL_TYPE: COMPOSITION
  EOS_MODEL: <eos model>
  COMPOSITION:
    # This is old
    H2O: <mole fraction>
    # This is new
    water: <mole fraction>
    nitrogen: <mole fraction>
    CO2: <mole fraction>
    methane: <mole fraction, required>
    ethane: <mole fraction>
    propane: <mole fraction>
    i_butane: <mole fraction>
    n_butane: <mole fraction>
    i_pentane: <mole fraction>
    n_pentane: <mole fraction>
    n_hexane: <mole fraction>
```
