# v8.3 to v8.4

CSV resource files must now include headings. If there is a column without a header (for example `HEADING1,HEADING2,` - the last `,` creates an empty column), you will get an error messages saying "CSV input file must include header". You can solve this by giving the column a name, or removing it.
