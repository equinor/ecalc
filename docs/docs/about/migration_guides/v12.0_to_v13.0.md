# v12.0 to v13.0

### Migration overview

#### Migrate ADJUSTMENT section for FACILITY_INPUTS

If you have been using [ADJUSTMENT](../references/ADJUSTMENT) section for `FACILITY_INPUTS`, you will need to adjust your input data accordingly, as this section has been removed in v13.0).

- **a.** If you have only loaded the file being used with `ADJUSTMENT` once, you can simply modify the original data file to include the adjustments directly. This can e.g. be done by copying data into Excel and apply the `Ax+b` formula directly to the data (ie. `data_value * factor + constant`), and save the file/overwrite the data in-place.
- **b.** If you have loaded the file more than once, or used different `ADJUSTMENT` settings for different instances, you will need to create separate data files for each instance, with the adjustments applied directly to the data in each file. Make sure that you
rerun your file after you have applied and saved the adjustments to the file, compare with original data, and see that there are no differences in the results.
