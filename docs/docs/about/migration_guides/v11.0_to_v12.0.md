# v11.0 to v12.0

### Migration overview

- If you have been using `GENERIC_FROM_INPUT` in a `SIMPLIFIED_COMPRESSOR_TRAIN` either directly or indirectly (e.g. through `COMPRESSOR_WITH_TURBINE`), you
will either need to
  - Change `GENERIC_FROM_INPUT` in the `COMPRESSOR_SYSTEM` to a model that is supported, e.g. `GENERIC_FROM_DESIGN_POINT`.
  - Take `GENERIC_FROM_INPUT` out of the `COMPRESSOR_SYSTEM` and use it as a standalone compressor.
