# v8.26 to v9.0

In this migration guide you will find:

1. [YAML changes](#yaml-migration)

## Yaml migration

### Migration overview

This doc guides you through migrating an existing eCalcâ„¢ model from version v8.26 to v9.0.

We try to make this as easy as possible, and provide a step-by-step migration guide.

### 1. Changes to compressor trains in MODELS
- `CONTROL_MARGIN` and `CONTROL_MARGIN_UNIT` are now required for `SINGLE_SPEED_COMPRESSOR_TRAIN`, `VARIABLE_SPEED_COMPRESSOR_TRAIN` and `VARIABLE_SPEED_COMPRESSOR_TRAIN_MULTIPLE_STREAMS_AND_PRESSURES`.

An example with new yaml implementation is shown below:

```yaml 
MODELS:
  - NAME: <model name>
    TYPE: SINGLE_SPEED_COMPRESSOR_TRAIN
    FLUID_MODEL: <reference to fluid model>
    PRESSURE_CONTROL: <method for pressure control, DOWNSTREAM_CHOKE (default), UPSTREAM_CHOKE, , INDIVIDUAL_ASV_PRESSURE, INDIVIDUAL_ASV_RATE or COMMON_ASV>
    MAXIMUM_DISCHARGE_PRESSURE: <Maximum discharge pressure in bar (can only use if pressure control is DOWNSTREAM_CHOKE)>
    COMPRESSOR_TRAIN:
      STAGES:
        - INLET_TEMPERATURE: <inlet temperature in Celsius for stage>
          COMPRESSOR_CHART: <reference to compressor chart model for first stage, must be defined in MODELS or FACILITY_INPUTS>
          PRESSURE_DROP_AHEAD_OF_STAGE: <Pressure drop before compression stage [in bar]>
          # This is new
          CONTROL_MARGIN: <Default value is zero>
          # This is new
          CONTROL_MARGIN_UNIT: <FRACTION or PERCENTAGE, default is PERCENTAGE>
        - INLET_TEMPERATURE: <inlet temperature in Celsius for stage>
          COMPRESSOR_CHART: <reference to compressor chart model for second stage, must be defined in MODELS or FACILITY_INPUTS>
          PRESSURE_DROP_AHEAD_OF_STAGE: <Pressure drop before compression stage [in bar]>
          # This is new
          CONTROL_MARGIN: <Default value is zero>
          # This is new
          CONTROL_MARGIN_UNIT: <FRACTION or PERCENTAGE, default is PERCENTAGE>
        - ... and so forth for each stage in the train
    POWER_ADJUSTMENT_CONSTANT: <Optional constant MW adjustment added to the model>
    MAXIMUM_POWER: <Optional constant MW maximum power the compressor train can require>
    CALCULATE_MAX_RATE: <Optional compressor train max standard rate [Sm3/day] in result if set to true. Default false. Use with caution. This will increase runtime significantly. >
```

### 2. Changes to simplified compressor trains in MODELS
- `CONTROL_MARGIN` and `CONTROL_MARGIN_UNIT` are not allowed for `SIMPLIFIED_VARIABLE_SPEED_COMPRESSOR_TRAIN`.

The new yaml implementation is described below, for simplified compressor train model with known compressor stages:

```yaml 
MODELS:
  - NAME: <model name>
    TYPE: SIMPLIFIED_VARIABLE_SPEED_COMPRESSOR_TRAIN
    FLUID_MODEL: <reference to fluid model>
    COMPRESSOR_TRAIN:
      STAGES:
        - INLET_TEMPERATURE: <inlet temperature in Celsius for stage>
          COMPRESSOR_CHART: <reference to compressor chart model for first stage, must be defined in MODELS or FACILITY_INPUTS>
          # This is old
          CONTROL_MARGIN: <Default value is zero>
          # This is old
          CONTROL_MARGIN_UNIT: <FRACTION or PERCENTAGE, default is PERCENTAGE>
        - INLET_TEMPERATURE: <inlet temperature in Celsius for stage>
          COMPRESSOR_CHART: <reference to compressor chart model for second stage, must be defined in MODELS or FACILITY_INPUTS>
          # This is old
          CONTROL_MARGIN: <Default value is zero>
          # This is old
          CONTROL_MARGIN_UNIT: <FRACTION or PERCENTAGE, default is PERCENTAGE>
        - ... and so forth for each stage in the train
    POWER_ADJUSTMENT_CONSTANT: <Optional constant MW adjustment added to the model>
    MAXIMUM_POWER: <Optional constant MW maximum power the compressor train can require>
```
- Simplified compressor trains have to use generic compressor charts
  - `SIMPLIFIED_VARIABLE_SPEED_COMPRESSOR_TRAIN` is restricted to generic compressor charts, i.e. the `COMPRESSOR_CHART` must be of type `GENERIC_FROM_INPUT` or `GENERIC_FROM_DESIGN_POINT`. The chart types `SINGLE_SPEED` and `VARIABLE_SPEED` are not allowed anymore.
