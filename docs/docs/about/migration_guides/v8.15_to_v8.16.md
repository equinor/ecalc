# v8.15 to v8.16

In this migration guide you will find:

1. [YAML changes](#yaml-migration)

## Yaml migration

### 1. New feature for GENERATORSETS
- New unit-format for venting emitters, aligned to what is used in other parts of yaml-file.

The new yaml implementation is described below:

Previously the format looked like this: 
~~~~yaml
RATE:
  VALUE: 2
  # This is old
  UNIT: kg/d
  TYPE: STREAM_DAY
~~~~

The new format is: 
~~~~yaml
RATE:
  VALUE: 2
  # This is new
  UNIT: KG_PER_DAY
  TYPE: STREAM_DAY
~~~~
