# v8.13 to v8.14

In this migration guide you will find:

1. [YAML changes](#yaml-migration)

## Yaml migration

### 1. New feature for GENERATORSETS
- Allow additional input related to `POWER_FROM_SHORE` category, in order to report extra output. The following keywords are now additional optional under `GENERATORSETS`:
  - `CABLE_LOSS`: Fraction, describing power loss from shore. Used to calculate actual power supply onshore.
  - `MAX_USAGE_FROM_SHORE`: The peak load/effect that is expected for one hour, per year (MW).

The new yaml implementation is described below:

```yaml
GENERATORSETS:
  - NAME: <generator set name>
    CATEGORY: POWER_FROM_SHORE
    FUEL: <optional fuel configuration reference>
    ELECTRICITY2FUEL: <electricity to fuel facility input reference>
    # This is new
    CABLE_LOSS: <optional file or value>
    # This is new
    MAX_USAGE_FROM_SHORE: <optional file or value>
    CONSUMERS:
      ...
```
