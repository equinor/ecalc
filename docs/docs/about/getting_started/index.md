# API Reference

:::info
Currently the *only* officially supported method is the [eCalc CLI](/about/getting_started/cli/index.md) using eCalc YAML models.
:::

There are three options to run eCalc models:

- [eCalc CLI](/about/getting_started/cli/index.md)
- [eCalc Python library](/about/getting_started/library/index.md)

## What method should I choose?

### eCalc CLI
Choose the [eCalc CLI](/about/getting_started/cli/index.md) option if you:

- Don't know much about programming
- Have simple requirements
- Can define the eCalc models statically

### Python Library
Choose the [Python Library](/about/getting_started/library/index.md) option if you:

- Are a developer or advanced user, and want to build eCalc models and get results programmatically
- Use Python, and you need to use (parts of) eCalc as a dependency
- Need access to "inner core functionality" of eCalc

:::note
Python Library is not yet officially available and not recommended to use due to upcoming breaking changes very soon
