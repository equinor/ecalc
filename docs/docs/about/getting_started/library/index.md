# Python Library
:::warning
It is currently **not recommended** to use the Python library due to upcoming breaking changes.
:::

If you choose to use the Python library programmatically when creating eCalc models, there is a greater flexibility in
dynamically changing the eCalc models.

See all commands and options in the [API reference](/about/references/api/index.md)
