# YAML

We have chosen the way to model eCalc models is in the YAML format. For a simple introduction to YAML, please see [here](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/)

The eCalc YAML model can either be run directly with the [eCalc CLI](../cli) or loaded using the [Python library](../library)

For getting started setting up your first eCalc YAML model, please see [Setup an eCalc Model](../../modelling/setup),
look at some example YAMLs [here](../../modelling/examples) and refer to the vocabulary that we use [here](../../references/keywords).
