# YAML

We have chosen the way to model eCalc models is in the YAML format. For a simple introduction to YAML, please see [here](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/)

The eCalc YAML model can either be run directly with the [eCalc CLI](/about/getting_started/cli/index.md) or loaded using the [Python library](../library)

For getting started setting up your first eCalc YAML model, please see [Setup an eCalc Model](/about/modelling/setup/index.md),
look at some example YAMLs [here](/about/modelling/examples/index.md) and refer to the vocabulary that we use [here](/about/references/index.md).

# JSON Schema

If you want to generate your own YAML to use with CLI eCalc, you can use the JSON schema that we have provided [here](ecalc_json_schema.json).
This schema is used to validate the YAMLs that are run in eCalc.
