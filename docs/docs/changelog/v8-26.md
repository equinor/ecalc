# eCalc v8.26

## Features

## Bug Fixes

- Emission intensities are no longer calculated and reported in the results, due to the following discrepancies:
CO2 intensity is defined as the total emission divided by the total HC export. eCalc only calculates the future data, so the correct CO2 intensity should be found by adding the historical to these future data. The hydrocarbon export rate is still reported to help the user calculate the CO2 intensity outside of eCalc.
Methane intensity was incorrectly calculated based on HC export. The common definition is the methane emission divided by the natural gas throughput of the wanted equipment- or installation level. This is safest done outside of eCalc to ensure proper definition.
