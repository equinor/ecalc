# eCalc



## New Features

- New error code `INVALID_MAX_RATE` and `INVALID_INPUT` and check added as a failure status for compressors
- Rate type is included in header for csv export. E.g. `Sm3/sd` for streaming day and `Sm3/cd` for calendar day.
- Generic variable speed compressor has a new and improved algorithm for design points


## Fixes

- Fixed bug with calculation in Simplified Train for Compressors
- Ensure that start date in global time vector is consistent with the requested output frequency. This makes sure that one can consistently and correctly calculate volumes based on results with rate. 

## Breaking changes

- Economic details have been deprecated from eCalc. Input data such as `tax`, `quota` and `price` for fuel and emissions will no be ignored, and will hence also no longer be reported. If you have used those in your model, they will be ignored. It will be treated as an error in a future version of eCalc.
