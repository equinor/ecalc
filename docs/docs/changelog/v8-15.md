# eCalc

## Fixes

- Add volume query for venting emitters of type `OIL_VOLUME`. This query was removed by mistake in earlier version. This ensures that oil loading/storage volumes are reported when the type is `OIL_VOLUME`.
- Fix unit for oil rates/volumes for venting emitters of type `OIL_VOLUME`. Required input volume unit is `Sm3/d`, and reported unit in LTP is changed from `t` to `Sm3` for oil loading/storage volumes.
- Ensure that regularity is evaluated for all installations when only venting emitters are defined for a particular installation. This caused eCalc to crash, if only venting emitters were defined.
- Make emission names for venting emitters case-insensitive, as it is for other emissions. This solves the problem of splitting/reporting the same emission type as separate ones - if e.g. nmvoc and nmVOC is given as input by user. The problem was discovered in v8.12.
- Fix values for Max Usage from Shore. Output should correspond to input. The problem was introduced in v8.14 with the addition of new columns for power from shore.
- Fix unit for Max Usage from Shore. Unit should be MW, not GWh.
- Detect duplicate keys in yaml-file, and raise error pointing to which line the error occurs
