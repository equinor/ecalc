# eCalc

## Fixes

- Add volume query for venting emitters of type `OIL_VOLUME`. This query was removed by mistake in earlier version. This ensures that oil loading/storage volumes are reported when the type is `OIL_VOLUME`.
- Fix unit for oil rates/volumes for venting emitters of type `OIL_VOLUME`. Required input volume unit is `Sm3/d`, and reported unit in LTP is changed from `t` to `Sm3` for oil loading/storage volumes.
