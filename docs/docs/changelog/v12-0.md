# eCalc v12.0

## Features

## Bug Fixes

## Breaking changes

- Pump will return `HEAD = 0` when `RATE == 0`, in results. Previously `HEAD` had a value, but was meaningless, because there is no stream/fluid through the pump.
- It is no longer allowed to use `SIMPLIFIED_COMPRESSOR_TRAIN` with unknown stages or unknown charts (`GENERIC_FROM_INPUT` or using `MAXIMUM_PRESSURE_RATIO_FOR_STAGE`) in a `COMPRESSOR_SYSTEM`. They can not be fully predefined, and can then potentially change between operational settings.
- As a consequnence of the item above, it is also no longer allowed to use `COMPRESSOR_WITH_TURBINE` with unknown stages or unknown charts (`GENERIC_FROM_INPUT` or using `MAXIMUM_PRESSURE_RATIO_FOR_STAGE`, ie. using `SIMPLIFIED_COMPRESSOR_TRAIN`) in a `COMPRESSOR_SYSTEM`.
