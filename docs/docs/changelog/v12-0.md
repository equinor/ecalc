# eCalc v12.0

## Features

- Add `DATES` (plural uppercase) as valid header name in timeseries resource. `v12.0.4`

## Bug Fixes

- The calculated power result has up until now not been checked against MAXIMUM_POWER for simplified trains. This is now fixed. If the power is above MAXIMUM_POWER, the result will not be valid. `v12.0.3`
- `CONDITION` and `CONDITIONS` on `VENTING_EMITTERS` had no effect. This is now fixed. `v12.0.3`


## Breaking changes

- Pump will return `HEAD = 0` when `RATE == 0`, in results. Previously `HEAD` had a value, but was meaningless, because there is no stream/fluid through the pump. `v12.0.1`
- It is no longer allowed to use `SIMPLIFIED_COMPRESSOR_TRAIN` with unknown stages or unknown charts (`GENERIC_FROM_INPUT` or using `MAXIMUM_PRESSURE_RATIO_FOR_STAGE`) in a `COMPRESSOR_SYSTEM`. They can not be fully predefined, and can then potentially change between operational settings. `v12.0.1`
- As a consequnence of the item above, it is also no longer allowed to use `COMPRESSOR_WITH_TURBINE` with unknown stages or unknown charts (`GENERIC_FROM_INPUT` or using `MAXIMUM_PRESSURE_RATIO_FOR_STAGE`, ie. using `SIMPLIFIED_COMPRESSOR_TRAIN`) in a `COMPRESSOR_SYSTEM`. `v12.0.1`
