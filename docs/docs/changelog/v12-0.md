# eCalc v12.0

## Features

## Bug Fixes

- The calculated power result has up until now not been checked against MAXIMUM_POWER for simplified trains. This is now fixed. If the power is above MAXIMUM_POWER, the result will not be valid.
- Fix: Restored condition mapping for VENTING_EMITTERS from YAML to domain objects. Updated expression evaluation logic and added tests to improve reliability.
