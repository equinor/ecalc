# eCalc v9.17

## Features
- **Added support for conditions in venting emitters**: Implemented functionality to handle conditions for venting emitters, allowing more precise modeling of scenarios such as when components are turned off, removed, or have zero rates. It also simplifies modeling the effect of an asset producing or not.
- Added CO₂ intensity calculation and export to CLI:
The CLI now calculates and reports CO₂ intensity. Results can be exported as separate CSV and JSON files. Emission intensity results were previously only available in the web interface.

## Bug Fixes

* Timeseries no longer remove fully empty rows or columns.
* Max standard rate should work correctly again.
