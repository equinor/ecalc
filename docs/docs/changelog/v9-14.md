# eCalc v9.14

## Features

## Bug Fixes

* The `MAXIMUM_POWER` keyword now also works with `VARIABLE_SPEED_COMPRESSOR_TRAIN_MULTIPLE_STREAMS_AND_PRESSURES`. Previously it had no effect, and no warnings.
* Mixing streams has been fixed to work correctly. The bug was minor and most likely had a very small impact.
