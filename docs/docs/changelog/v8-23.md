# eCalc v8.23

## Features

- `POWER_ADJUSTMENT_FACTOR` for models: Optional factor to adjust the power (MW). Previously only the
  `POWER_ADJUSTMENT_CONSTANT` has been available for models, now it is possible to adjust/scale the power with a
  constant and a factor. It can be used to calibrate equipment.

## Bug Fixes

- Default pressure control was added to variable speed train, but missing for single speed and multiple streams.

## Breaking changes

- H2O is no longer supported in composition. Use 'water' instead.
