# eCalc



## New Features

## Fixes

- Make sure that maximum standard rate calculations takes a potential maximum power constraint into account for single speed compressor trains and variable speed compressor trains.
- is_valid in json now contains booleans (integers in v8.8)
- energy_usage_unit and power_unit no longer in csv, json. The unit is still available in the csv header, and as the `unit` property in json (inside `energy_usage` and `power` ++)

## Breaking changes
