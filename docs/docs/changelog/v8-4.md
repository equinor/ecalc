# eCalc



## New Features
- Add requested inlet- and outlet compressor pressures from input data to results. In cases where active pressure control mechanisms are active, requested inlet- and outlet pressures may differ from pressures calculated by eCalc. It is now possible to analyse both requested- and calculated pressures.
