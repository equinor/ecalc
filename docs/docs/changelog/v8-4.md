# eCalc

## New Features

- Add `requested inlet- and outlet compressor pressures` from input data to results. In cases where active pressure control mechanisms are active, requested inlet- and outlet pressures may differ from `calculated pressures`. It is now possible to analyse both requested- and calculated pressures.
- Specify `rate type` for majority of output `rate` results as either `stream day` or `calendar day`.
- Improved error messages

## Fixes

- `Actual rate` was incorrectly returned for `compressor sampled`. Actual rate cannot be known for `compressor sampled` since we need to know `fluid properties` in order to do that. `Actual rate` has therefore been removed from `compressor sampled`.
- Handle bug in `Variable Speed Compressor Train With Multiple Streams And Pressures` when no rate is entering a compressor stage wrt. recirculation. 
- Other minor fixes

## Breaking changes

- CSV resource files must include headings. If there is a column without a header (for example `HEADING1,HEADING2,` - the last `,` creates an empty column), you will get an error messages saying "CSV input file must include header". You can solve this by giving the column a name, or removing it.
