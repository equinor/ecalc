# eCalc v9.18

## Features

- Added CO₂ intensity calculation and export to CLI:
  The CLI now calculates and reports CO₂ intensity. Results can be exported as separate CSV and JSON files. Emission
  intensity results were previously only available in the web interface.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug in the `VARIABLE_SPEED_COMPRESSOR_TRAIN_MULTIPLE_STREAMS_AND_PRESSURES` model:
  For cases where there have been multiple streams with different compositions entering the compressor train **prior** to a
  stage where there is an interstage pressure there has been a bug in the calculations. This has had no effect on models
  where additional streams were added at of after the stage where there is an interstage pressure.
