# eCalc v9.11

## Features
Invalidate negative fuel rates fuel consumers with DIRECT type energy usage models. 
DIRECT type models need to define either LOAD (electrical consumer) or FUELRATE (fuel consumer).  
Negative load values can be valid in some cases (e.g., energy efficiency measures on generator sets).
Negative fuel rates are now always invalid.
