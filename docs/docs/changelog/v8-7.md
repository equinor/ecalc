# eCalc



## New Features

- Change emission rate type to calendar day, in alignment with the fuel rate which is also calendar day. 
- Update documentation with info about changing name from direct emitters to venting emitters. Both keywords will exist in the documentation for a while, with a description of which keyword is valid for which verisions of eCalc.

## Fixes

- Bug in compressor with turbine models with multiple streams and only one date.
- Fix bug when aggregating model results, where the first model was wrongly reported as the aggregated result.
- Fix problem with missing compressor chart when combining trains/compressors.
- Improve error message when model/facility input does not exist.


## Breaking changes

- Change name from `DIRECT_EMITTERS` to `VENTING_EMITTERS` in input Yaml-file. Using DIRECT_EMITTERS will not cause eCalc to fail (this will change in a future version), but no output will be given for the actual emitters if the deprecated keyword is used.
