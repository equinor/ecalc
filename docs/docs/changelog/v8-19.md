# eCalc

## Features
- Implement adjustment factors for genset: Make sure fuel consumption is scaled according to the adjustment factor and constant given in facility inputs.Make venting emitters emission names case insensitive: Avoid splitting same emission-types into separate ones, due to different use of upper- and lower case.
- Improve error message for extra pfs columns: Improve error message to point at the problematic column (or both columns if they are in the model).

## Bug Fixes
- Error message for compressor model in turbine.
- Do not allow multiple energy model types: It is not allowed to switch types of energy_usage_models when using temporal models. This will now give error.
