# eCalc v8.1

eCalcâ„¢ v8.1 is a smaller upgrade from v8.0. Here are some of the highlights:

## New features

- Bug fixes


## Breaking changes

Some breaking changes are needed to keep improving eCalc, remove ambiguity and prepare eCalc for the future:

### Input: YAML / Resource files

1. We do no longer accept missing data in resource or timeseries resource files, since it easily leads to ambiguities and errors.
2. New Category: STEAM-TURBINE-GENERATOR has been introduced, which works similar as OFFSHORE-WIND
3. TIME_SERIES has had a makeover with new type and renamed attributes, to be less ambiguous and error-prone. 

### Output: LTP

1. A few columns in LTP export has changed names in order to be compatible with Centuries
2. A new column in LTP export has been introduced: steamTurbineGeneratorConsumption (matching with the new category)
