# eCalc

## Breaking Changes
- Do not allow pressure drop ahead of stage for simplified variable speed trains: Defining `PRESSURE_DROP_AHEAD_OF_STAGE` for a simplified variable speed train does not have any effect. eCalc now gives an error if specified, instead of ignoring it.
- Do not allow control margin for simplified variable speed trains: Defining `CONTROL_MARGIN` for a simplified variable speed train does not have any effect. eCalc now gives an error if specified, instead of ignoring it.
- Do not allow 0 efficiency in input chart: Give earlier feedback to user, and point to the relevant file.


## Features
- Make sure that pressure calculation tolerances are the same at different places in the code: Can give minor result changes because the calculation is more accurate (adding iterations in the calculation of the outlet pressure of a compressor stage).
