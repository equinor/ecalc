# eCalc v8.3

eCalcâ„¢ v8.3 is a smaller upgrade from v8.2. Here are some of the highlights. See
the migration guide for details on changes, where relevant.

## New Features

- To save time in calibration and help diagnose pump issues: When calibrating or seeing why a pump is invalid, the most important thing to look at is the head. Now the head is available in the JSON file.

## Fixes

- A bug in the mixing of fluid-streams in compressor trains were fixed. This bug caused the density at standard conditions not to be updated, leading to the standard rates being wrong. This is expected to change the results of some eCalc Models

## Breaking changes

Some breaking changes are needed to keep improving eCalc, remove ambiguity and prepare eCalc for the future:

### Input: YAML / Resource files
 
1. It is no longer accepted to change `ENERGY_USAGE_MODEL TYPE` over time, within one consumer. In case `TYPE` evolution is needed, the model can be split in two consumers.
