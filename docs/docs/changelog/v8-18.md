# eCalc

## Features
- Improve error messages for invalid characters in variables names.
- Make sure all time series are resampled: All time series are now resampled to avoid inconsistent results when date frequency is not data defined.
- Simplify unit-definitions in Yaml (continuation of breaking change in v8.16): Write `SM3_PER_DAY` instead of `STANDARD_CUBIC_METERS_PER_DAY`. Write `KG_PER_DAY` instead of `KILO_PER_DAY`.

## Bug Fixes
- Fix error that occurs when creating error message related to wrong category for power from shore columns/variables (CABLE_LOSS and MAX_USAGE_FROM_SHORE only valid for category POWER_FROM_SHORE).

## Documentation
- Change `TURBINE_LOAD` to `TURBINE_LOADS`.
- Clean up documentation for compressor modelling including adding some missing keywords.
- Update input data for Simple model example, to avoid invalid timesteps (update water production rate to meet the maximum rate of the pump chart)
- Update Advanced model example with new updated yaml file. Changes in modelling to avoid invalid timesteps.
- Update documentation about fluid models adding missing yaml keywords.
- Update documentation to have correct units for venting emitters.
