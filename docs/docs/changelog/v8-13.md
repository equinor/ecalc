# eCalc

## New Features

- Add type and multiple emissions vor venting emitters

## Documentation

## Breaking changes
- Add type and multiple emissions vor venting emitters. The TYPE keyword is required, and can be either DIRECT_EMISSION or OIL_VOLUME.
  - Venting emitter TYPE DIRECT_EMISSION: Multiple emissions are specified under EMISSIONS, defined by NAME and RATE.
  - Venting emitter TYPE OIL_VOLUME: A new VOLUME parameter is introduced. It takes RATE, which is defining the oil volume associated with loading/storage, and EMISSIONS. Multiple emissions are possible, defined by NAME and EMISSION_FACTOR. The emission factor is used to calculate emissions as a fraction of the loading/storage volumes
