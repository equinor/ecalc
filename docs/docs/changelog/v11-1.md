# eCalc v11.1

## Features

- Results at consumer level (`FUEL_CONSUMERS` and `CONSUMERS` under `GENERATOR_SETS`) will no longer overwrite results with the
  result from the previous timestep when results are invalid (ie. results from valid steps would extrapolate over invalid results).
  Instead, the actual result will be returned. This means that you can now safely trust the results, even when they are invalid, to
  better understand what is needed in order to make them valid.
