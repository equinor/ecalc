# eCalc v11.1

## Features

- Results at consumer level (`FUEL_CONSUMERS` and `CONSUMERS` under `GENERATOR_SET`) will no longer overwrite results with the
  result from the previous timestep when results are invalid (ie. results from valid steps would extrapolate over invalid results).
  Instead, the actual result will be returned. This means that you can now safely trust the results, even when they are invalid, to
  better understand what is needed in order to make them valid. You may experience that the `GENERATOR_SET` will contain invalid points where it previously did not. This will be because the (invalid) power demand from a consumer with an invalid point is now reported/aggregated to the `GENERATOR_SET`. This invalid power demand may exceed the power demand extrapolated from the last time step, which was reported earlier. If the total power demand for a `GENERATOR_SET` goes above the maximum power it will fail to provide sufficient power, and therefore be reported as invalid. There should be no changes in valid/invalid time steps at asset level. **NOTE**: It is highly recommended to use *Data Defined Output* frequency when evaluating invalid data, as using a fixed frequency may make it difficult or impossible to understand invalid date.
