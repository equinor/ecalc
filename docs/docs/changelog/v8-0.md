# eCalc v8.0

eCalc™ v8 is finally here! This new release brings a lot of nice new features and better usability. Here are some
of the highlights:

## New features

- Improved the accuracy of the compressor and pump models
- Changes to CSV output 
  - reduced the number of columns
  - simplified headers, added units
  - renamed power_rate to power
  - the is_invalid column is now reported as is_valid
- Changes to LTP:
  - renamed loading and storage columns
  - added categories for flare, fugitive emissions, name should no longer be used
- Changes to JSON:
  - json_v1 and json_v2 has been removed.

## Experimental features
- Add maximum power limit for compressor models

## Breaking changes

Some breaking changes are needed to keep improving eCalc, remove ambiguity and prepare eCalc for the future:

### YAML

1. All component names must be unique to avoid ambiguity in reporting
2. UNITS are required when setting up compressor and pump charts
3. Restrict allowed characters in component names and emission names
4. NAME no longer used for LTP reporting, use CATEGORY instead
5. Not possible to use custom category names, pre-defined categories must be uppercase with hyphen as separator (i.e. FUEL-GAS)

### CLI

1. Invoking eCalc™ directly is no longer supported, use `ecalc run` instead.
2. Log level should be specified as the first argument + log to file
3. Model yaml-file needs to come last
4. Extrapolation (correction) is now always used and cannot be disabled
5. Argument for LTP export has changed from: `--centuries-ltp-export` to `--ltp-export`
6. Simple results are now default for json
