# eCalc v11.0

## Features

## Bug Fixes

## Breaking changes

- We now **REQUIRE** all references to be **UNIQUE**, i.e. names in `FACILITY_INPUTS`, `MODELS` and `FUEL_TYPES` should not be the
  same across the different keywords.
- Names within a consumer system **MUST** be **UNIQUE**.
- Pressures **MUST** be **NON-NEGATIVE** when `RATE` is non-zero, otherwise it is considered a validation error.

### CLI

- Remove `operational_settings_results` from compressor/pump system json result. In most use-cases this result isn't
  used.
  If you used this result, let us know, then we can consider supporting your use-case.
