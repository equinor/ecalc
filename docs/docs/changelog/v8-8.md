# eCalc



## New Features

- Updated NeqSim to version 2.5.9. This may lead to small numerical differences in the results when old models are re-run with the latest version of eCalc.
- Provide maximum rate in CompressorModelResult (if there are more than one stream, only max rate for  the first one is reported)
- Support for specifying `RATE_TYPE` (`STREAM_DAY` or `CALENDAR_DAY`) for `VENTING_EMITTERS`
