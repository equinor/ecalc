# eCalc v8.2

eCalcâ„¢ v8.2 is a smaller upgrade from v8.1. Here are some of the highlights. See
the migration guide for details on changes, where relevant.

## New features

- STP is available as a predefined TSV file-export of data. Use argument `--stp-export` on cli.
- Output emissions in fixed and predicted order in JSON export
- **BREAKING**: `Conditions` in YAML model that evaluates to **false** will *no longer* be calculated and outputted
- Using average rates instead of forward filling when resampling rates to a given output frequency
- New `Categories` added to STP and LTP export
- Operational settings are now 1-based instead of 0-based.

## Fixes
- Some VARIABLE_SPEED_COMPRESSOR_TRAIN_MULTIPLE_STREAMS_AND_PRESSURES models have returned a too low INTERSTAGE_PRESSURE when using INDIVIDUAL_ASV_RATE control. The INDIVIDUAL_ASV_RATE fixed speed pressure control now returns the required INTERSTAGE_PRESSURE correctly.
