# eCalc v8.2

eCalcâ„¢ v8.2 is a smaller upgrade from v8.1. Here are some of the highlights:

## New features
- STP is available as a predefined TSV file-export of data. Use command --stp-export on cli.

## Fixes
- Using average rates instead of forward filling when resampling rates to a given output frequency

### Output: LTP

1. Column Total CO2 is removed from LTP output (both for fixed & mobile installations)
2. Add relevant columns in ltp-file for the two new consumer categories [`HEATER`](../references/keywords/CATEGORY) and [`BOILER`](../references/keywords/CATEGORY)
3. Re-order some of the columns in the ltp-file, for more logical order
4. Move column for CO2 fugitives for more logical structure: CO2-column "co2VentingMass" moved after other CO2-columns
5. Turbine-columns are now filtered on the two consumer categories [`TURBINE-GENERATOR`](../references/keywords/CATEGORY) and [`GAS-DRIVEN-COMPRESSOR`](../references/keywords/CATEGORY), as it is no longer only turbines that are consumers of FUEL-GAS

### Output STP
1. Remove CH4 column for mobile installations in stp-file
2. Change names of stp output columns to align headings with Centuries, for proper import of data
3. Report CO2 emissions for both fixed- and mobile installations

## Yaml
### LTP configuration
- Two new consumer categories are added: [`HEATER`](../references/keywords/CATEGORY) and [`BOILER`](../references/keywords/CATEGORY)
