# eCalc v8.2

eCalcâ„¢ v8.2 is a smaller upgrade from v8.1. Here are some of the highlights:

## New features
- STP is available as a predefined TSV file-export of data. Use command --stp-export on cli.

## Fixes
- Using average rates instead of forward filling when resampling rates to a given output frequency

### Output: LTP

1. Column Total CO2 is removed from LTP output (both for fixed & mobile installations)
