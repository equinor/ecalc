# eCalc v7.3


## *Features*

* BREAKING CHANGE!:
    `Fixed speed pressure control` options changed. One option is added, where the ASV is modelled as
    being common for the entire train, and the names of the options with individual ASVs have changed.
    The available options for pressure control in a single speed compressor train are now:

    * UPSTREAM_CHOKE
    * DOWNSTREAM_CHOKE
    * COMMON_ASV (NEW)
    * INDIVIDUAL_ASV_RATE (changed from ASV_BALANCED_MARGIN)
    * INDIVIDUAL_ASV_PRESSURE (changed from ASV_WITH_BALANCED_PRESSURE_RATIOS)

## *Fixes*

* Power rate reporting now works for consumer systems for supported compressor models for LTP reporting.
