# eCalc v9.7

## Features

## Changes 

* eCalc now support NumPy 2.x. eCalc will also support NumPy 1.x for a while, but we recommend upgrading to NumPy 2.x as soon as possible.

## Bug Fixes

* We have increased required memory for the Java process to 4 GB by default, since some compressor models with fluid properties require more memory to run. Beware that currently this will require up to 6 GB of memory to make sure that eCalc runs smoothly. Previously
eCalc crashed if not enough memory was allocated.
