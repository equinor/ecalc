# eCalc v9.1

## Features

* Upgrade NeqSim to v3.0.5 (from v2.5.21). This can affect fluid/EoS operations, but we have not registered any changes. There may be a small speed up in fluid operations.
* `CONTROL_MARGIN` is no longer experimental!

## Bug Fixes

* Max Rate algorithm has been changed. The new version is a correct, but brute force algorithm. This will affect processing time negatively, but guarantee correctness.

## Breaking changes


## Documentation

Compressor charts in documentation now shows surge line, control margin and stonewall for improved understanding.
