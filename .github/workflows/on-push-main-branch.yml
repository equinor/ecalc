# NOTE: We trigger release-please in the on_workflow_run instead, freeing it from this workflow,
# and creating a separate workflow for it, that we again can listen to and trigger the publish workflow from.
# Also, we want to build and test the library before we trigger the release-please workflow,
# so that we can be sure that the library is in a good state before we release it, and instead of doing it twice,
# we wait until that is done on the main branch first.
