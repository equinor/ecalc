  # Note! We cannot trigger on published event, since that can only be triggered when done manually (or with a
  # separate PAT token, not the standard GITHUB_TOKEN), and we want to use the standard GITHUB_TOKEN).
  # Therefore we trigger this workflow independently, after the trigger-publish workflow has run, in
  # order for this workflow to be the owner of the PyPI publishing job, and can be verified. This limits
  # us to only allow this workflow to be allowed to publish to PyPI trustedly.

  workflow_dispatch: # Trigger manually, if needed.

  # NOTE!: When using Trusted Publishing to PyPI, we cannot do that from within a reusable workflow, therefore
  # we make it independent, and trigger it with published event from release-please workflow, instead of calling explicitly.
