# Overview

This is a Development Container for GitHub Codespaces in order to edit the documentation using VSCode in your browser
instead of running it locally.

## How to use
1. Go to the repository on GitHub
2. Click on the "< > Code" -> Codespaces -> Create Codespaces
3. Start working. E.g. create a new branch and start contribute

Note: the docs development server will spin up automatically together with the devcontainer. You may have to 
use the Ports-tab in order to navigate to the documentation preview.
