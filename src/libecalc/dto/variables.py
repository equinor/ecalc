    A variable name has the format "{name_of_case};{title_of_header} from the original
    file/resource with time series, ie;

    A file is named "reservoir1" and contains headers "rgi" and "pwi", then this will
    result in 2 mappings in this object; "reservoir1;rgi" and "reservoir1;pwi", which
    can be referred to in the eCalc YAML.

    Currently, the relevant variables are sent/injected to the components that have used
    it in the yaml, but at some point it may be replaced with the data/parameters directly,
    ie the variables will be evaluated before the calculation starts.

    The variables must be interpolated and extrapolated before being added to the variablesmap,
    to make sure that the resolution of ALL variables are the same for everywhere it is being used,
    BEFORE the calculation starts; ie happens as a pre step before calculation, and not in the calculation
    directly.
