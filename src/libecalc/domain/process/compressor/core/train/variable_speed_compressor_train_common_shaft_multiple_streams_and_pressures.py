    """An advanced model of a compressor train with variable speed, with the possibility of modelling additional
    streams going into or leaving the compressor train between the compressor train stages.

    In general, a compressor train is a series of compressors that are running with the same shaft, meaning they will
    always have the same speed. Given inlet conditions (composition, temperature, pressure, rate) for all ingoing
    streams, pressures and rates for outgoing streams (not counting the outlet at the final stage - it is what it
    becomes), and a shaft speed, the intermediate pressures (and temperature before cooling) between stages and the
    outlet pressure (and temperature) is given. To solve this for a given outlet pressure,
    one must iterate to find the speed.

    Streams:
    Models of the streams in the compressor train. See FluidStream
    Can be used with any number of streams going into or leaving the compressor train.
    The inlet of the first compressor stage must have an ingoing stream connected.

    Stages:
    Models of the compressor train stages. See CompressorTrainStage.
    For each stage, one must specify a compressor chart, an inlet temperature and whether to take out liquids before
    compression. In addition, one must specify the pressure drop from previous stage (may be 0).

    minimum_speed:
    The minimum speed of the compressor train shaft.
    If not specified it will be calculated from the given compressor charts for each of the stages

    maximum_speed:
    The maximum speed of the compressor train shaft.
    If not specified it will be calculated from the given compressor charts for each of the stages

        Simulate the compressor train for the given inlet conditions, stream rates, and shaft speed.

        This method models the flow through each stage of the compressor train, accounting for multiple inlet and outlet
        streams, anti-surge valve recirculation, and possible subtrain configurations. It computes the resulting outlet
        stream, per-stage results (including conditions and power), and overall train performance.

        Typical usage scenarios:
            1. Standard train: self.streams[0] is the main inlet.
            2. First subtrain (with intermediate pressure target): self.streams[0] is the inlet.
            3. Last subtrain (after a split): self.streams[0] may be an entering or leaving stream, and the inlet fluid
               is set from the first subtrain.

        Args:
            constraints (CompressorTrainEvaluationInput): Pressures, stream rates, and speed for the simulation.
            asv_rate_fraction (float, optional): Fraction of anti-surge valve recirculation. Defaults to 0.0.
            asv_additional_mass_rate (float, optional): Additional mass rate for recirculation. Defaults to 0.0.

        Returns:
            CompressorTrainResultSingleTimeStep: Object containing inlet/outlet streams, per-stage results, speed,
            total power, and pressure status.
