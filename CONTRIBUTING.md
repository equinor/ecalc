# Contributing

## Terms and conditions for contributions

Any contributions will undergo review before they are (potentially) accepted. eCalcâ„¢ is licensed under LGPL, and any accepted contribution will be merged under the same license.

Equinor will attempt to respond to bug reports and improvement proposals, but Equinor is not liable for maintenance on
behalf of external users.

We welcome external contributions on bug reports and smaller bug fixes. Unfortunately, we cannot accept all kinds of contributions due to lack of capacity and the need to control the direction to support future needs within Equinor.

Feel free to create issues for bug reports or questions about the code. For questions about future direction and strategy contact margh@equinor.com

## Guidelines for contributions

There are a few things you need to know.

We wrote a [Contribution Guide](docs/docs/contribute/get_started.md) to help you get started.
